**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** ‚Äî the most common attack vector in web security testing.

---

### **Step 1: DOM-Based XSS (as shown earlier)**

Here‚Äôs the vulnerable code again with clear testing steps:

#### **Vulnerable HTML (DOM-Based XSS)**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>DOM XSS Test</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Message:</h2>
        <p id="output"></p>

        <script>
            // DOM XSS vulnerability
            const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
            const message = params.get("msg");
            if (message) {
                document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = message;
            }
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

---

#### **How to Test:**

Open this in your browser and run:

```
    http://127.0.0.1:5500/XSS/DOM-Based%20XSS/index.html

    http://127.0.0.1:5500/XSS/DOM-Based%20XSS/index.html?msg=<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>
    üß® Warning: Some browsers or extensions may sanitize or block inline <script> injections by default. If it doesn't pop an alert, try using a more sneaky payload (still for educational purposes only).
```

**Expected behavior**: JavaScript alert should pop up ‚Äî this confirms the DOM is injecting raw unsanitized HTML/JS from the query parameter.

---

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Alternative Payloads (for testing):

Try these in the `msg` parameter:

-   Basic script:

    ```
    <script>alert('XSS')</script>
    ```

-   Image-based (often bypasses basic filters):

    ```
    <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
    ```

-   Inline event:

    ```
    <svg onload=alert('XSS')>
    ```

    # So How to Fix this vulnerability

    **both exploiting and fixing** vulnerabilities will level up your web security skills big time. üí™

### ‚úÖ Recap: DOM-Based XSS (Vulnerable)

You already have the test working:

```javascript
document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = message;
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Fix: DOM-Based XSS (Safe Version)

Use **textContent** instead of `innerHTML` to prevent raw HTML injection:

```html
<script>
    const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    const message = params.get("msg");
    if (message) {
        // Safely output as plain text
        document.getElementById("output").textContent = message;
    }
</script>
```

---

### ‚úÖ Result:

Even if a user tries:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5500/XSS/DOM-Based%20XSS/index.html?msg=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

It will now just **display** `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` as plain text ‚Äî not execute it.
